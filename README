perform a t test on stack overflow data 
the stack overflow data contain information on software developers the age when the developer first started coding (age_first_code_cut) and compensation as an adult (converted_comp)
H0 is that the age when the developer first started coding (age_first_code_cut) has no significance on compensation as an adult (converted_comp) 
better said: whether or not the coder coded as a child does not improve income as an adult

load in the data

separate age_first_code_cut into adult and child and get the mean
continue with ttest on this data assuming the means are equal and not significant
get the means of the child coding and adult coding group

get the standard deviation of the child coding and adult coding group

get counts of the numbers of each group

calculate the t_stat

because we are using a t test with a t distribution because we have multiple sample stats mean child and mean adult

perform a t-test to determine if the mean difference salary is significant for child coders vs adult coders with significance of 0.1
since we already have the tvalue or t_stat, we just need the degrees of freedom
calculate the degrees of freedom

import t from scipy.stats so we can perform the cdf for t distribution

perform the t.cdf with right tailed test (1 - t.cdf) bc we are seeing if mean_child_income is GREATER than mean_adult_income
